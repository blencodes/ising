# Ising
Ising model created May 2022 during a quantum computing workshop led by Harvard and MIT PHD students. 
Coded a 2-color and 3-color model. 

A graph of average magnetizations made by iterating through temperatures. Can visualize the critical temperature (where the sudden drop to nearly 0 is).
